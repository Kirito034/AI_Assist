Dear Team,

I regret to inform you that I will not be able to attend work today as I am feeling unwell. I woke up this morning with a high fever and severe body aches, and it quickly became clear that I would not be able to perform my duties effectively.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and will do my best to catch up on any missed work once I am feeling better. In the meantime, please do not hesitate to reach out to me if there is anything urgent that needs my attention.

I hope to recover quickly and return to the office soon. Thank you for your understanding and support.

Best regards,

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I am writing this note with a heavy heart,
For I cannot be at work, my health's falling apart.
My body aches and my fever's high,
I know I can't work, I'll only lie.

I apologize for the short notice,
And any inconvenience, oh what a nuisance!
I'll catch up on my work, once I'm well,
And hope to return soon, and ring the office bell.

Wishing you all a healthy and productive day,
Take care of yourselves, and keep the germs at bay.

Yours sincerely,

[Your Name]
