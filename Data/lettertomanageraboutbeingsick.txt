Subject: Notification of Sick Leave

Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to inform you that I am not feeling well and will not be able to come to work for the next few days. I woke up this morning with a high fever, severe body aches, and a persistent cough. After consulting with my doctor, I was advised to take some time off to rest and recover.

I apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and will do my best to ensure that my tasks are up to date before I leave. If there are any urgent matters that need my attention, please let me know, and I will try to address them remotely.

I will keep you updated on my progress and let you know as soon as I am well enough to return to work. Thank you for your understanding and support during this time.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
