Hello Acer, I'd be happy to help you with that! Here's a simple code in C language to print "Hello World":
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
   printf("Hello World\n");
   return 0;
}
```
When you run this code, it will display the message "Hello World" followed by a newline character. The `#include <stdio.h>` statement includes the standard input/output library, which contains the `printf()` function used to print output to the console. The `main()` function is the entry point of the program, and it returns 0 to indicate that the program has executed successfully.
